# Cermati Data Engineer Recruitment Test
## Overview
Thank you for considering my application. This program was created as part of the recruitment process for the Data Engineer position at Cermati. It is designed to fulfill the specified requirements and criteria of the test. I parallelize the web scraping for each department.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Ensure it is set to maximize the browser window, and verify that the "job" menu on the [Link Cermati careers page](https://www.cermati.com/karir) is not inside a hamburger menu.

## Usage
To use this program:

- Run the program according to the specified requirements.

- If you encounter any issues or the program does not meet the criteria, consider the following:

	- Library Installation: Double-check that all required Python libraries are installed correctly.

	- Webdriver Configuration: Ensure that the webdriver is properly configured, and the browser window is maximized.

	- Web Page Structure: Verify that the "job" menu on the Cermati careers page is not inside a burger menu.
